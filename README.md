# pythonZipper is a program that can compress files has ".FDB" extensions.
It utilizes lzma algorithm for high ratio compression.
Its default behavior is to compress files that residing in same directory with the script. 
Of course it can be changed. 
Also file extension - FDB - can be changed if you desire.
Good luck.
